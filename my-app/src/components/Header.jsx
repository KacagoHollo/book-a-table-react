      What do we believe in? In the family, which guarantees a family atmosphere, we also know that we want to give you the best. You no longer have to go to Budapest in the hope of a good pizza. We here in Dunakeszi offer this experience with traditional Neapolitan pizza. The point is in the smallest details, the excellent ingredients, and our love for pizza. 
      <br/>
      Our ingredients come from Italy, high-quality 00 flour, as well as San Marzano tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella, which come from the protected region of Campania. The dough, which has been fermented for at least 48 hours, is hand-stretched and baked in an authentic wood-fired oven at 450 degrees for 1-1.5 minutes. The Neapolitan pizza is characterized by a thin hair inside, while the edges are airy and crunchy, on which the flame of the wood fire draws ornate dots. Can you imagine that? Don't just imagine, try it! Call us and book a table now! You know you're going to be in love!
