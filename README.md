# book-a-table-react

A pizzeria's site with a booking form.
Input validation: User can submit the form only, if he/she gives the proper data (e.g. e-mail validation). User can't booking a table before the actual date, and can't book a table one hour before the actual time.
For clicking the button logs out the booking information to the console.

The time input doesn't work properly on Mozilla and Safari, because they are partly supported by them.
